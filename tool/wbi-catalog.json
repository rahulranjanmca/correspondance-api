When youâ€™re travelling outside the United States, you have access to doctors and hospitals in more than 200 countries and territories around the world through the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreÂ® Program. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind before and during your travel: 1. Verify your international benefits with Wellmark before leaving the United States by calling the Customer Service number on your member ID card. Your benefits may be different when you are outside the country. 2. Always carry your member ID card. In an emergency, go directly to the nearest doctor or hospital, then call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core. 3. For non-emergency inpatient medical care, you must call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core first. The Service Center can arrange access to a hospital, provide information on doctors and give you information about payment. Toll-free: 1-800-810-2583 Collect: 1-804-673-1177 (Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreÂ®) 4. When pre-certification/pre-authorization is required, call Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core.
